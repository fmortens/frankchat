# README

so this is a very limited chat application just to show how swift and Firestore can be used.

### Requirements

- Xcode
- Swift 4.2
- Firebase
- Cocoapod

## Setup

The project contains a podfile so in theory all you need at this point is to run

`pod install`

## Licence

Feel free to play around with the code, no worries. Note: I will at some point remove the backend, so if you use it you should set up your own project at firebase.

### Todo

A lot of improvements to be done, but for now it only has basic functionality. I would want to improve stuff like this later:

- Better error handling
- Better structuring of code
- Better performance
- Notifications and sound
- Search for contacts rather than show everything
